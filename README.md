## Demo

You can view a fully working demo at [Heuristic](https://https://heuristic-gamma.vercel.app//).

## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmelodyxpot%2Fheuristic&env=NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY&project-name=heuristic&repository-name=heuristic&demo-title=Heuristic&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fheuristic-gamma.vercel.app%2F)

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#clone-and-run-locally).

## Clone and run locally

1. You'll first need to clone the repository [via this url](https://github.com/melodyxpot/heuristic)

2. Install dependencies using yarn

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and update the following:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT URL]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT API ANON KEY]

   SERVER_URL=https://localhost:3000
   ```

   Both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` can be found in [your Supabase project's API settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api)

4. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   The project should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
